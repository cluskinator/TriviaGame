# TriviaGame

Contains a Trivia Game I titled 'Around The World'. 

The main coding concepts in it are forming a two-layered for loop for iterating through questions and their subsequent answers.
The second concept is manipulating the DOM by dynamically creating divs and ids to compare other concepts.

Uses HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript.

Thanks,
